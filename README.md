A simple flascard game built using JavaScript, HTML and CSS: [Flashcard Game](https://flashcard-hoan.netlify.com)

Note: this is a very simple flashcard game that I made during my first week of the Codaisseur web-development program (a 10-week coding bootcamp overall). Although it's nothing fancy of the game, at that time, I did not have any knowledge on web development and building a game as simple as that using all JS, HTML and CSS has already been a small achievement to me and set the first milestone on my way to become a professional web-developer.
