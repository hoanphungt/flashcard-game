### Note: 
- This simple flashcard game was made during my first week of the Codaisseur web-development program (a 10-week coding bootcamp overall). Although it's nothing fancy of the game, at that time, I did not have any knowledge on web development and building a game as simple as that using all JS, HTML and CSS and in one day only has already been a small achievement to me and also set the first milestone on my way to become a professional web-developer.
